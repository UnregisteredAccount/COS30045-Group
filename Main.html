        <h1>Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD)</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our data visualization project, which delves into the critical and complex topic of cardiovascular disease. As one of the leading causes of death worldwide, cardiovascular disease affects millions and imposes significant social, economic, and healthcare burdens.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Using four data visualizations, we aim to shed light on key aspects of cardiovascular disease, including its prevalence, risk factors, trends over time, and impacts on different populations. These insights are essential for understanding the scope of the issue and for informing efforts to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and improve public health outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Stroke Mortality in Europe</h2>
            <p>In 2021, strokes and other cerebrovascular diseases accounted for 6% of all deaths across European OECD countries. Strokes occur due to a disruption in blood supply to the brain, leading not only to high mortality rates but also to significant long-term disability. The highest mortality rates were observed in Bulgaria, Latvia, and Romania, where rates exceeded most other European nations.</p>
            <p>Since 2011, most European countries have seen a decrease in stroke mortality, averaging a reduction of 25%. This decline is largely attributed to lower smoking rates, better quality of care, and improved survival rates post-stroke. However, some countries, such as Latvia, experienced a slight increase in mortality rates over the decade, underscoring the persistent socio-economic disparities in stroke outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Cardiovascular Disease Indicators In Europe</h2>
            <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) indicators such as cholesterol and glucose levels, smoking, and alcohol consumption were key factors in determining the health outcomes. These indicators have a strong correlation with CVD prevalence, as shown in a dataset of 70,000 patient records. The data revealed that high cholesterol and glucose levels, smoking, and alcohol consumption were more prevalent in individuals with CVD, while non-smokers, non-drinkers, and those with normal cholesterol and glucose levels had lower CVD rates.</p>
            <p>Shift in health behaviors were shown, with reductions in smoking rates and alcohol consumption contributing to lower CVD prevalence. Therefore, addressing these risk factors will be crucial in reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases in the future.</p>

            <h2>Mortality Rates from Cardiovascular Diseases in Europe</h2>
            <p>In 2021, heart attacks and other ischaemic heart diseases (IHDs) accounted for 11% of all deaths in OECD countries. Mortality rates are 83% higher for men than women across OECD countries, primarily because of a greater prevalence of contributing risk factors among men, such as smoking, high-blood pressure and high cholesterol.</p>
            <p>Among OECD countries, Central and Eastern European countries had the highest IHD mortality rates – particularly Lithuania, where there were 395 deaths per 100,000 population. Rates were also relatively high in Latvia, Hungary, Mexico, and the Slovak Republic. Korea, Japan, France, and the Netherlands had the lowest rates among OECD countries, at about one-third of the OECD average.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Death Overview</h2>
            <p>In 2021, over 12 million people died across OECD countries – equivalent to 932 deaths per 100 000 population Across OECD countries in 2021, heart attacks, strokes and other circulatory diseases caused more than one in four deaths; around one in five deaths were related to cancer. Population ageing largely explains the predominance of deaths from circulatory diseases – with deaths rising steadily from age 50.</p>
            <p>Looking at other specific causes, Alzheimer’s and other dementias accounted for 6% of all deaths; they were a more important cause of death among women than men. Diabetes represented 3% of all deaths across OECD countries. The main causes of death differ between socio‑economic groups, with social disparities generally larger for the most avoidable diseases. For example, people with the lowest level of education are more likely to smoke in most OECD countries, increasing the risk of developing cancers and diseases of the respiratory system</p>
